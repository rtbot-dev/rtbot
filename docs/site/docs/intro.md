# Introduction

RtBot is a model of computation and a framework for processing digital signals in real time. Its main goal is to provide
the tooling for the development lifecycle of programs that can process numerical streams of data, and produce signals
from these, in real time and with the minimum possible latency. It provides a set of composable building blocks that
allows it to process the signals, allowing it to create programs that can detect peaks or anomalies in incoming signals
as fast as possible, for instance.
